Certainly! Here's the combined markdown content for setting up Git Large File Storage (LFS) in your project, based on the instructions I provided earlier:

# Working with Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Git LFS is a Git extension that improves handling of large files by replacing them with text pointers inside Git while storing the file contents on a remote server. Below are the steps to set up and use Git LFS in your project.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install Git LFS. Follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Git LFS by visiting [this link](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```
````

## Tracking Large Files

You need to specify which files should be tracked by LFS. You can do this with the `git lfs track` command followed by a file pattern. For example:

```bash
git lfs track "*.psd"
```

This command will track all `.psd` files in the repository with LFS. You can replace `*.psd` with the pattern that matches the large files in your project.

## Commit and Push Changes

Once you have tracked the large files, you need to add, commit, and push them as you would with any other files. For example:

```bash
git add .gitattributes # Don't forget to add this file, as it contains the LFS tracking information.
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
git push origin main
```

## Cloning and Pulling Repos with LFS

When others want to clone or pull the repository, they should have Git LFS installed. The usual `git clone` and `git pull` commands will work. LFS-tracked files will be automatically handled by Git LFS.

## Resolving Issues with LFS Quota

If you encounter an error related to data quota, it means the repository has exceeded its LFS data allowance. You may need to purchase more data packs or clean up old unused LFS objects.

## Conclusion

Git LFS is a powerful tool for managing large files within Git repositories. By following these instructions, you can efficiently store and collaborate on large files without bloating your repository.
